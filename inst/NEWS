- First submission to BioConductor 
Changes in version 1.9.2 (29.01.2019)
- Added an argument class.vec to the function getMarkerGenes.rnaseq() to provide the classes of samples in the data matrix
- Changed default of the argument annotate to FALSE
- Fixed an error caused when no markers are found
Changes in version 1.10.1 (02.08.2019)
- fixed the error that caused failed build of the package as follows:
Changed the argument "entrezgene" used in getBM() to "entrezgene_id", since this was changed in the Ensembl database and caused an error in the internal function '.get.genes.rnaseq()'.
